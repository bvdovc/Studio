	<title>Li-Ion Stanby Power Supply (SPS)</title>

	<span>
		<p>The Li-Ion SPS-es provide redundant DC power to engines and to the InfiniBand (IB) interconnects and reside only in system bays. SPS-es consist of the following components:
		</p>
	<ul>
		<li>AC-line inlet </li>
		<li>Batteries </li>
		<li>Battery charger</li>
		<li>DC-DC converter</li>
		<li>RS232 port</li>
		<li>4 AC outlets </li>
	</ul>
	</span>
	<span>
	<p> During the online operation, the SPS supplies DC output load directly from the AC-line input. The charger maintains a float charge on the batteries and recharges them when necessary. If the AC-line input fails, the output is disconnected from the AC-line input and is instead supplied by the internal batteries and DC-DC converter (On-Battery operation).
