	<title>SYSTEM BAY 2-4</title>
	<span><p>System bays house one or two V-Bricks in open systems and one or two zBricks in mainframe host environments.
A V-Brick or a zBrick consists of an engine, two high-density, 120-drive Disk Array Enclosures (DAEs), two Li-on standby power supplies (SPS-es) to provide backup power to the engine, and two power distribution units that supply power to redundant power zones ( zone A and zone B). </p></span>
