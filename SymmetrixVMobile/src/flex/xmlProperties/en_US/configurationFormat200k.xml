		<p>The VMAX 200K is configured with one to four 2.6 GHz, 32 Ivy Bridge (IVB)core engines with 512, 1024, or 2048 GBs of memory per engine. With the maximum four-engine configuration, the VMAX 200K supports up to (2880) 2.5" drives, or up to (1440) 3.5" drives, providing up to 2.28 PB of usable capacity when using 4 Terabyte drives. Engines reside in system bays that support single- or dual-engine system bay type.

			The 200k supports EFT, performance, and capacity disks to maximize array performance across all drive types. To enable the EMC Fully Automated Storage Tiering (FAST) technology fine tune your 200K performance while reducing cost by leveraging lightning fast speed of Flash drives combined with cost effective NL-SAS drives, the array needs to be populated with the drives of different technologies to meet your application workload requirements.
