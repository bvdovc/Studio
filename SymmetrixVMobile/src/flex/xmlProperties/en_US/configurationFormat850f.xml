	<span><h>Description:</h></span>
	<span><p>The VMAX 850F range in size from one up to eight v-Brick/z-Brick systems. A v-Brick for open systems and a z-Brick for mainframe are the basic building blocks  that include: </p></span>
		<span>
			<ul>
				<li>An engine (the redundant data storage processing unit) using 12-Core Intel Xeon E5-2650-v2, 2.7 GHz CPUs</li>
				<li>A starter capacity of 53Tbu of flash drives distributed across two dense Disk Array Enclosures (DAEs) , each supporting a maximum of 120 2.5" drives.</li>
				<li>Software available in simple ordering options:  F/FX for open systems, zF/zFx for mainframe</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<span><p> An initial 53 TBu v-Brick/z-Brick configuration can be: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scaled up by adding 13TB flash capacity (open systems)/zCapacity (mainframe) packs that bundle all required storage capacity and software</li>
				<li>Scaled out by adding v-Bricks/z-Bricks to increase performance, connectivity, and throughput.</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<span><p>
			Independent and linear scaling of both capacity and performance makes the VMAX 850F arrays extremely flexible at addressing varying workloads.
