	<span><p>The array configurations are designed for enterprise storage environments. The array configurations include at least one system bay that can house from one to eight engines and a number of half or fully populated storage bays, depending on the number of engines in the array.  Engines are the key I/O processing units that provide cache, CPU power, front-end (host) and back-end connectivity to drives in the array.</p></span>
	<span><p>The maximum array configuration size depends on the type of Disk Array Enclosures (DAEs) in use.  If only 15-drive standard DAEs are used, the maximum array configuration includes an eight-engine system bay and 10 storage bays. If high-density 25-drive DAEs are configured, the maximum configurations consist of a system bay and eight storage bays. Both DAE types can be used within the array but not within the same storage bay.</p></span>
	<span><p>DAEs from dedicated storage bays and dedicated DAE locations connect to a dedicated engine in the system bay. Depending on the way the DAEs connect to the engine, they are referred to direct-connect or daisy-chain DAEs.</p></span>
