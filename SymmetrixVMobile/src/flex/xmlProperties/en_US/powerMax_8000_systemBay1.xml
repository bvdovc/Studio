	<span>
		<p>System Bay 1 houses from one to a maximum of 4 Bricks/zBricks in PowerMax 8000 arrays. A Brick/zBrick consists of an engine, DAEs, and a pair of SPS-es.</p>
	</span>
	<span>
		<p>The difference between Bricks and zBricks are:</p>
	</span>
	<span>
		<ul>
			<li>The base storage capacity is 53 TBu for Brick and 13 TBu for zBricks</li>
			<li>The I/O modules that provide host connectivity are Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and/or FICON (mixed systems only) for Bricks and FICON only for zBricks.</li>
	   </ul>
	</span>
	 <span>
		<p>In addition to the Brick/zBrick components, System Bay 1 houses the InfiniBand interconnect and Ethernet switches. These are components specific to System Bay 1.</p>
	 </span>
	 <span>
		<p>Accessible from the rear, there is a full-height, vertical Power Distribution Unit (PDU) on each side of the rack.</p>
	</span>
	<span>
		<p>The System Bay 1 population starts at the bottom with SPS-es for Engine 1, followed by DAEs, Engine 1, SPS-es for Engine 2, then Engine 2. The population in the top half mirrors that at the bottom by starting with Engine 3, SPS-es for Engine 3, Engine 4, DAEs, and SPS-es for Engine 4 at the top of the rack.</p>
	</span>
	<span>
		<p>Each Brick/zBrick owns one and shares one DAE. Three fully populated DAEs therefore provide the storage capacity for two Bricks/zBricks. The shared DAEs house universal spare drives that reside in dedicated drive slots.</p>
