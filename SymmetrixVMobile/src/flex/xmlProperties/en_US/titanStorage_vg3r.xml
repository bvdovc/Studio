		STORAGE BAY
	</title>

	<span><p>Storage bays are optional and only supported with dual-engine system bays. A storage bay must be bolted to its system bay and cannot be dispersed. The storage bays support the same DAE types as the system bay and can support from one (1) to a maximum of eight (8) DAEs of any combination. Storage bays house up to 8 DAEs, 4 per each engine in the associated system bay.</p></span>
    <span><p>The storage bays require three-phase or single-phase power and can be configured for either Delta(4 wire for domestic installations) or WYE(5 wire for International installations) input power.  Each three-phase powered bay supports two power connections. Each single-phase powered bay requires a minimum of four power connections.</p></span>
