		<p>Engine is the central I/O processing unit, redundantly built for high availability. Redundant directors (director A and director B) each contain cache,  two 12-core Broadwell 2.5 GHz CPUs, and attach interfaces to I/O modules, such as universal front-end, back-end NVMe, InfiniBand, compression and dedupe, and flash NVMe I/O modules. Engine provides 48 CPU cores and a maximum of 2TB cache.</p>
