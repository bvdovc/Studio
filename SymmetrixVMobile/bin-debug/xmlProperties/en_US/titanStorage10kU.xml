		STORAGE BAY
	</title>
	<span><p>Storage bays are supported in standard array configurations. They house from two to 8 Disk Array Enclosures (DAEs), and NAS Gateway components that provide file-level access to data in the array. NAS Gateway components use dedicated power components connected to redundant power sources.</p></span>
	<span><p>The storage bay power components include Power Distribution Units (PDUs), and Power Distribution Panels (PDPs). Unlike the system bays, the storage bays do not have Standby Power Supply modules that provide backup power to storage bay DAEs.</p></span>
	<span><p>The PDPs and PDUs can be accessed from the rear and provide the centralized interface and distribution control for the input AC power. The PDPs connect to the input AC power lines, provide the main on/off power switch, and also connect to the PDPs within the same power zone. The PDPs further distribute power to individual components and also contain the on/off power switches. Power components on each side of the bay belong to independent power zones that must be connected to independent AC power lines to ensure power redundancy.</p></span>
