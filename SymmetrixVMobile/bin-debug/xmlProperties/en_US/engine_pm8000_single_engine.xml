		<p>Engine is the central I/O processing unit, redundantly built for high availability. Redundant directors (director A and director B) each contain cache, two 18-core Broadwell 2.8 GHz CPUs, and attach interfaces to the I/O modules, such as universal front-end, back-end NVMe, InfiniBand, compression and dedupe, and flash NVMe I/O modules. Engine provides 72 CPU cores and a maximum of 2TB cache.</p>

		<p>The following diagrams illustrate a rear view of a PowerMax 8000 engine in a single- and multi-engine configuration. The diagrams show the I/O module types, slot designations, and port numbering. Not all universal front-end and flash NVMe slots are occupied in a typical configuration.</p>
